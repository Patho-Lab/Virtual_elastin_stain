# Deep Learning-Based Virtual Elastin Staining for VPI Assessment in NSCLC

This repository contains the code and resources for the research paper titled **"Deep Learning-Based Virtual Elastin Staining Improves Visceral Pleural Invasion Assessment in Lung Cancer"**. The project develops a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN)-based pipeline to generate synthetic Eosin-Based Elastin Fluorescence (EBEF) images from standard Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained whole-slide images (WSIs). This virtual elastin staining enhances the assessment of Visceral Pleural Invasion (VPI) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), reducing reliance on specialized stains like Victoria Blue.
